# 1. Introduction
  My design implements a player inventory using a HashTable<string, unsigned Int>. The string would be the key and the item name. The unsinged int would be the number of those items the player has.
The downside to this structure is that the elements are not always in a predictable order. This would make it harder to display the inventory in its entirety in a consistent manner.

# 2. Design Philosophy
Hashtables ability to access elements in O(1) time is very desirable. I envision the inventory as a grid system, similar to games like Minecraft, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Terraria.
This is the format I prefer and find the most sensical. It lays all items in view for the player, and can allow for sorting of items. While this can sometimes make the inventory feel cluttered, it makes
everything visible at once instead of having to scroll or search for waht you are looking for.
The client for this class would be a game that uses an inventory system that allows for duplicates. The user would be someone playing a game that implements that class.
